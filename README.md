# Simulating Git Flow

This repository demonstrates the simulation of Git flow using the Git Flow extension. Git Flow is a set of git extensions that provide high-level repository operations for Vincent Driessen's branching model. In this simulation, we'll walk through the steps to set up Git Flow in your local environment.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Git Flow installed. You can install it using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) with the following command:

```bash
brew install git-flow
```

````

## Getting Started

1. Initialize Git Flow in your repository by running the following command:

```bash
git flow init
```

2. You will be prompted to choose branch names for the main branches. Select the default options as recommended in the Git Flow documentation:

   - **Branch name for production releases:** `main`
   - **Branch name for "next release" development:** `develop`

   You can customize these names based on your project requirements.

3. Once Git Flow is initialized, you can start using its features. Here are some common Git Flow commands:

   - Start a new feature:

     ```bash
     git flow feature start <feature-name>
     ```

   - Finish a feature:

     ```bash
     git flow feature finish <feature-name>
     ```

   - Start a release:

     ```bash
     git flow release start <release-version>
     ```

   - Finish a release:

     ```bash
     git flow release finish <release-version>
     ```

   - Start a hotfix:

     ```bash
     git flow hotfix start <hotfix-version>
     ```

   - Finish a hotfix:

     ```bash
     git flow hotfix finish <hotfix-version>
     ```
